# Research

My research focuses on the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), investigating its climatic and sedimentological impacts using methods like XRF analysis and astronomical chronology.

Key research areas:
- Sedimentation rates and orbital forcing during the PETM.
- Earth system modeling using cGENIE to simulate climate impacts.
