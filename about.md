# About Me

I am Qingqing Jiang, a master's student at Peking University. My primary research interests include geology, paleoclimatology, and astronomical chronology, with a focus on the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). I am also exploring Earth system models to understand the orbital forcing on climate systems.

In addition to my academic interests, I enjoy canyoning and outdoor adventures.
